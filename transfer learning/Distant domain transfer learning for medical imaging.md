#### A. conventional transfer learning

There are two types of accessible transfer learning: feature-based and instance-based.
- Feature-based: map source features and target features into a **common feature space** where the **distribution mismatch is minimized**;
- Instance-based: discover source instances **similar to** target instances, so that **highly unrelated source samples would be eliminated**. 

Both of them assume that the source domain and target domain share a fairly strong connection.
