### Abstract
- This study is related to a not well-investigated but important transfer learning problem, termed Distant Domain Transfer Learning (DDTL). 
- In this study, we develop a DDTL model for COVID-19 diagnose using unlabeled image data sets as the source data, and a small set of labeded COVID-19 lung CT as the target data. 

### Related Work
#### A. conventional transfer learning

There are two types of accessible transfer learning: feature-based and instance-based.
- Feature-based: map source features and target features into a **common feature space** where the **distribution mismatch is minimized**;
- Instance-based: discover source instances **similar to** target instances, so that **highly unrelated source samples would be eliminated**. 

Both of them assume that the source domain and target domain share a fairly strong connection.

#### B. Distant Domain Transfer Learning (DDTL)
- DDTL focuses on using the knowledge in other domains to imrpove the performance of the target task.
- $e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0$
